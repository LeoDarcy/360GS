# Data preparation

## Panorama dataset

We collect panoramas from [Omnidirectional Computer Vision (OmniCV) workshop](https://github.com/mvlchallenge/mvl_toolkit). Please follow the instruction on their official site and download the pilot split. The dataset is for non-commercial academic use only, and it's under the [Matterport open source license](https://matterport.com/legal/matterport-end-user-license-agreement-academic-use-model-data). We are grateful for their contributions to the field.


We have released our [dataset](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/fcff039e50d1452681ae/).
